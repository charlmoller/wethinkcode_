# 42

This repo is a consolidation of the work from my time at WeThinkCode_, a selective and innovative software engineering school based on the [*42 school*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)) model.

# Modules

The course is broken down into modules, subdivided into projects completed in the span of 2-6 weeks each.  

## Year 1

- #### Unix (C)

`unix_libft` - Rebuiling the C standard library functions from scratch.  
`unix_printf` - Fully featured and extended "printf" clone.

- #### 3D Graphics (C)

`graph_fdf` - Displaying, scaling and rotating 3D model wireframes.  
`graph_wolf3d` - Graphical replication of the original wolfenstein, in 2.5D.  
`graph_rtv1` - Physically based ray traced rendering of 3D primitives with shadows.

- #### Algorithms, Compilers & VM's (C)

`algo_filler` - Go-like game where bots compete to fill space on a board.  
`algo_lemin` - Graph traversal project.  
`algo_pushswap` - Sorting algorithms, implemented using only 2 stacks.  
`algo_corewar` - Involves building an assembler and a virtual CPU to load/run binaries. No libraries allowed.

- #### Web development (NodeJs/PHP/HTML/CSS)

`web_camagru` - Basic image-sharing website built in bare PHP.  
`web_matcha` - Dating website built in NodeJS with express routing and MongoDB. No frameworks allowed.

## Year 2

- #### OOP and 3D game development (C++)

`cpp_abstractvm` - Building a stack-based virtual machine.  
`cpp_bomberman` - 3D recreation of the classic Bomberman game.

- #### Cloud Infrastructure (Docker/Kubernetes/GCP)

`cloud_docker` - Learning to use Docker.  
`cloud_cloud-1` - Deploying automatically scaling application instances to google cloud.
