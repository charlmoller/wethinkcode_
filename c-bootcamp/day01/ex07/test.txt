Taking a proactive approach means fighting the instinct to delay
consultation because it is still early days and you don’t have all the
answers yet or are worried about raising expectations. The reality,
most likely, is that people’s expectations are already raised in some
form or other, and that speculation about the project and the company is beginning to circulate.
Early engagement provides a valuable opportunity to influence public perception and set a positive
tone with stakeholders early on. Be clear upfront that there are still
many uncertainties and unknowns, and use early interactions with
stakeholders as a predictor of potential issues and risks, and to help
generate ideas and alternative solutions on early design questions.
